COMPREHENSIVE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
============================================================
Runs analyzed: 3

INSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE (Average of 3 runs):
Instruction                   Cycles   Time(ns)  Energy(J)   StdDev
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

CACHE HIERARCHY PERFORMANCE:
----------------------------------------
L1 Cache Access     :    2.4 cycles
L2 Cache Access     :    2.3 cycles
L3 Cache Access     :    2.5 cycles
RAM Access          :   43.0 cycles

INSTRUCTION CATEGORY AVERAGES:
----------------------------------------
Basic Arithmetic Avg     :  1.778 cycles
Logical Operations Avg   :  0.789 cycles
SIMD Float Avg           :  1.185 cycles
SIMD Integer Avg         :  1.185 cycles

PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS:
------------------------------

RECOMMendations:
--------------------
• Use SIMD instructions (SSE/AVX) for parallel operations
• Avoid division when possible - use multiplication by reciprocal
• Memory-bound operations benefit from cache-friendly access patterns
• Consider instruction-level parallelism for better throughput
6. Restoring system settings...
Setting cpu: 0
Error setting new values. Common errors:
- Do you have proper administration rights? (super-user?)
- Is the governor you requested available and modprobed?
- Trying to set an invalid policy?
- Trying to set a specific frequency, but userspace governor is not available,
   for example because of hardware which cannot be set to a specific frequency
   or because the userspace governor isn't loaded?
